# Transfer learning In pre trained models
The study in this project is to use convolutional neural network architecture and computer vision 
techniques to estimate the calories from popular food items in the United Kingdom.In this project, I study the use of a prominent 
deep learning model, Inceptionv3, to perform semantic segmentation of popular food images in the UK. The fully connected layers of the models were replaced with layers suitable for pixel wise segmentation. The networks are trained and validated several times and results are recorded. Additionally, the network architecture of Inceptionv3 network was studied as part of this project for a better understanding of CNNs. The datasets are pre processed and labelled 
using MATLAB apps and functions. The entire experiments were carried with a single CPU (11th Gen Intel(R) Core (TM) i5-1135G7) and 8 GB RAM memory. The device specifications were found to significantly affect the training procedures and the results obtained. 

# Custom Created Dataset
the dataset created contains popular british food items obtained from the publically available websites and captured on an android phone. the data set is included in this repository by the name preprocessed_data. A small snip of the folder is shown below.
